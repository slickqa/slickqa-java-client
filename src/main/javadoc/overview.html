    If you are just getting started with the slick client api, take a look at the
    <a href="com/slickqa/client/SlickClient.html">SlickClient</a> Interface.  It has complete code
    samples for the low level api.  Soon enough, there will be a higher level api that will ease the effort
    required to file results in slick.
